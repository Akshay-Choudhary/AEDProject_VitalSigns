Patient Management System was a project that I developed during my Application Engineering Development course at Northeastern University about which I am very proud of. 

The main objective of developing this application was to make the whole effort of managing the patient’s and their respective Vital sign records easily. This application was entirely developed in Java along with Java-Swing. Some of my coding abilities reflected in this application are as follows:
•	Managing the User Navigation.
•	Ability to move from a person focused person JPanel to its associated patient focused one.
•	Ability to move back to the previously visited JPanel.
•	Integrating JChart for visualizing vital signs of a particular patient.

# Use cases for this application are as follows:

# A.	Managing Person profiles:
•	Create a person profile.
•	Using search or table selection, select a person and view person record in detail. The person record will include summary of patient information such as the patient id and a list of vital signs.
•	Browse person list.
•	View and update person profile.

# B.   Mange Patient Profile: 
•	Create a patient profile and link to an existing person(must create person first).
•	Define vital signs for a patient and maintain them as a history of vital signs. The vital signs will include all the ones we defined before in the table.
•	One should be able to update a vital sign if it was wrong.

# C.   Reporting:
•	The user selects a person through a search.
•	For the selected patient the vital signs are shown in table format allowing the user to see trends in the person’s health. For example, the history of BP over must be shown in the graph nicely displayed. 
•	Allowing the user to go back to do a search for another patient and display all their vital signs graphically as well.
